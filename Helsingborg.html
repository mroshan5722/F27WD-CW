            <h3> Kärnan (The Kernel)</h3> <br>
            <img class="img1" src="Images/kernel.jpg" alt="The Kernel">
            <p>The town's emblem and landmark, the "Kernel," or Kärnan, is immediately visible to travelers arriving by water. This prominent brick tower, standing 35 meters tall, rises at the upper end of the lengthy market square (Stortorget). Two towers frame a long flight of steps leading up to Konung Oscar II's Terrass, where the original medieval defense tower stands, at the far end of the plaza. It was originally part of a Danish castle and was built in the 1300s as the focal point of a stronghold that was built on the site of an even older timber fortress, most likely dating from the 10th century. Only the tower remained after the rest of the castle was demolished in 1680.</p>

                <img class="img2" src="Images/Fbotanical.jpg" alt="Botanical Garden">
                <p>The Friluftsmuseum (Fredriksdal Open-Air Museum & Botanical Garden) is a must-see site for the whole family and a voyage through the centuries. You can take a walk around the farm and see a real working Skne farm, as well as a number of old yet well-preserved country cottages and outbuildings. The old 18th-century Fredriksdal Mansion, a Music Museum, a Botanic Garden, the Grafiska Print Museum, and an open-air theater are among the other attractions. The farm animals will delight children, while traditional delicacies and even roses may be purchased at the old town quarter's flower shop. Fredriksdal is, in essence, the old rural Skne, stretched out over 360,000 square meters in an extremely unique location. On-site concessions, as well as a well-stocked gift shop, are available.</p>

                <p>Helsingborg's magnificent neo-Gothic town hall (Helsingborgs rdhus), which dates from 1870 and is one of the city's most eye-catching landmarks, is located at the lower end of Stortorget. The structure has a 65-meter-tall tower with stained-glass windows portraying events from the town's history. There are tours offered with a guide. In front of the town hall are memorial stones for Norway and Denmark, remembering Sweden's help during the occupation of these countries by the Germans during WWII, and opposite is the well-known statue of Swedish General Count Magnus Stenbock (1664-1717)</p>
