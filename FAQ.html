            <h3>Can the trip be cancelled?</h3>
            <p>Should the trip be canceled, Feel free to contact me if the bill and information has not  reached you about 10 days before departure.Then you may have time to book another trip or move to another departure date that we know will go <br><br>
            The bill will not be sent until we see that the trip is canceled, so you pay nothing until the bill and travel program comes to you. If the bill arrives earlier, the departure is guaranteed the shipping company can charter out the entire ship at short notice, which means that the trip is canceled due to this.</p>
            <h3>Covid-19 and infection information</h3>
            <p>The pandemic seems to be under some sort of control. Many are vaccinated, even in Estonia, and people are getting vaccinated more and more.</p>
            <p>Most have received a paper or receipt for the vaccination, you can also order a so-called "covid pass" on your mobile phone. Right now (end of November) there are controls because it is feared to increase. It is counted in the number of infected 100,000 people. If the number exceeds 75 in the country where you come from, you are required to have proof of vaccination or that you have had the infection earlier within 6 months. But bring these papers or bring home a fresh covid passport on the phone. You can come to Estonia without these documents. Be sure to hand hygiene cough or sneeze into the armpit and keep the social distance as far as possible, even if you are vaccinated. Keep in mind that there are other infections as well.</p>
