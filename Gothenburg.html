            <img class="img2" src="Images/GothenburgMuseum.jpg" alt="Gothenburg Museum of Art">
            <p>The Gothenburg Museum of Art (Goteborgs Konstmuseum) houses one of the finest collections of art in Northern Europe. The collection includes works from the 15th century to the present day, with a focus on Nordic art. Carl Larsson, Edvard Munch, Anders Zorn, Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Claude Monet, Rembrandt, and many others are among the artists featured here. Temporary exhibitions, family activities, lectures, workshops, guided tours, a store, and a café are all available at the museum. The picture exhibitions at the museum's Hasselblad Centre are also worth seeing. The yearly Hasselblad Award Winners Exhibition is a highlight.

            <img class="img3"src="Images/Skansen.jpg" alt="Skansen Kronan">
            <p>Skansen Kronan fortress, a short walk from the city's old Haga quarter and up a steep flight of stairs, gives magnificent views of the city as well as a peek of Swedish history. The castle, which was completed in 1697, was intended to guard against the possibility of Danish assaults from the south. Gothenburg, on the other hand, was never assaulted in this manner, and the cannons inside have been inactive for generations. During the nineteenth century, the structure was used as a prison, then as a private residence, and finally as a military museum in the twentieth century. The location now includes a restaurant and a conference center. A summer café serves home-baked cakes, pastries, and ice cream in the ancient army barracks close to the tower.</p> <br><br><br><br>
